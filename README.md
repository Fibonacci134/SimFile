# SimFile
These are mere alterations to a couple files provided by the official Simswap repo. 
All changes made by me are not meant in anyway to take credit for the repo
The goal of this repo is to help people in setting up simswap and to try making changes to suit the individual.

videoswap.py changes are minor, it will output the result_directory in png format which will reserve quality much better than jpeg
#TODO upload reverse2original.py that will speed up iteration by a bit.
